								<h3>I love to create and make things.</h3>
								<p>Life is filled with too many opportunities to limit yourself. I want to make the best of everything that comes my way.</p>
								
								<hr />

								<h4>Here's some cool stuff I've done</h4>
								<p>In the near future, I will have created my own business, pursuing my love of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. I am dedicated to the world of technology because of it's rapidly growing part in todayâ€™s society. As a student at Waukee High School, I was never fully challenged. Many of the classes offered were not specialized to a technology driven future. While I took what was available, I still felt the need to continue learning. I began attending classes in the subjects of linux network administration, java programming, and computer security at DMACC, my local community college. I have also sought out extra curricular opportunities to further my skills. Over the summer of 2015, I was given the opportunity to intern with Minburn Telecommunications, a technology company that supplies internet, television, and telephone services to surrounding areas. While with the company, I was able to learn how my acquired classroom knowledge can be applied in the real world. </p>

								<p>Additionally, I was given the opportunity to intern with Merchants Bonding Company through the School to Work partnership program my senior year of high school. After being selected to this program, I was able to learn the value of ensuring that your passion should be held to a higher standard than your paycheck. In the future, I wish to become a pioneer in the business of creating a less career-limiting technology field for both men and women. I have already completed nearly fifty college credits before my high school graduation,and I aspire to gain my degree in computer science within the next three years. Then, in a few more, work my way to an upstanding job at a major company like Google. A mere thirty percent of innovators currently with Google are female, however, I am certain I will someday contribute to their team. Why do I want a career in STEM? Because it is fun. Because it is engaging. Because it is challenging. But most of all, because it is rewarding.
								Technology is changing the world for the better, and I am going to be a part of this revolution. I am taking the road less traveled. I have aspirations in technology.</p>
