									<h2>Behold, ladies and gentlemen, running is good for the soul.</h2>

									<h3>And yeah, that's basically it</h3>
									<p> In February, I reluctantly signed up for the Marion Arts Festival Half
									Marathon with my big sister. She somehow convinced me that running my first
									half marathon would be an extraordinary way to celebrate my high school graduation.
									The day before our monumental event, we purchased matching t-shirts that read
									13.1, symbolizing both our motivation and desire. </p>
									<p>On May 16th, three months after purchasing my ticket for the run, I felt
									as though I was underprepared. After dripping sweat for countless hours across
									my local gym’s treadmills and inside track, our run had arrived. The first mile
									was easy, as it always is. After embarking into the second mile, I felt a rush of
									pain throughout my body and a strong desire to quit. In that moment, the encouragement
									from other runners along the way inspired me to focus on my goal. Their cheers and
									support energized my spirit. After making it to mile five, I was ready to give in
									and bike my way to the finish. Biking is considerably easier than running. After
									13.1 miles, my sister and I triumphantly raced to the finish line. The minded effort
									it took to complete this run paved my path to victory. We crossed together, courageously
									cheering each other on. My face was pale, my legs were jelly, and my heart was racing. </p>
									<span class="image featured"><img src="../images/marion.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>After crossing the finish line, the paleness of my face was identical to that
									of a ghost. Giving up was never an option, no matter how much I felt like dying.
									Yes, running is excessively difficult. Yes, running is imprudently demanding. But
									in that very moment, I knew I had done it. I had accomplished something others thought
									to be impossible. And to me, impossible is just a word. Its meaning has been morphed
									over time to represent something so far from its true connotation that its very essence
									is a desired outcome. Because of this, life is filled with so many different emotions,
									which, in turn, create memories. Moments like these create a lasting impact of possibilities.</p>
									<h3>There are possibilities in everything</h3>
									<p>The more in depth I thought about this belief, the more I agreed with its
									premise. In the twenty-first century, people are inclined to give plausible
									explanations on the successful, such as their knowledge, unique fortune, and
									other distinct qualities. No doubt, they will not reap achievement without these
									factors. However, the truth is that their success largely depends on the great efforts
									others hardly know. What's more, people are likely to claim their own failure is solely
									due to intelligence, which is superficial and ridiculous in my opinion. Let’s put it this
									way. For instance, the mathematical exam is on a scale of 100, and it’s really easy to
									achieve 60 points if you have right attitude on it. It takes your efforts to hit 80 points,
									and you really need to be very hard working if you would like to get 95 points. But, it somehow
									needs a bit gift to achieve 99 points. Actually, with 95 points, you have already been very
									competitive and it has nothing to do with your IQ. Personally, in most cases it never happens
									to beat IQ when competing with other people, but only the degree of diligence.</p>
									<span class="image featured"><img src="../images/ashes.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<h3>Achieving more</h3>
									<p>Normally, we consider people who are the talented because
									of their expertise on a specific field basically. Essentially, it is just
									because they have a good command of knowledge on that field. Without a little
									hard work, any given individual will have no emotional attachment into the game
									they are in. Whether you are a football player, a New York Times columnist, or a
									stay at home dad, every little task takes work. Most of those tasks, however, are
									done with minimal effort when the individual sees their strengths as talents. I
									also agree that becoming competitive is all too necessary when faced with a difficult
									task. Everything in life takes time. If you quit and give up on a dream you’ve had
									since a small child, all of your hard work and effort will be erased. </p>
									<p>I feel that once you put in a certain amount of work, that task does not get easier
									- You just get better at it. As talent is a ‘natural aptitude or skill’, hard work
									simply remains a positive step in a sequence of events. Talent can be related to a
									skipping stone grazing the surface of a lake. The stone will eventually fall in but
									before it does, it bounces down a path. Many individuals with natural talent are able
									to skip a few steps. However, everyone eventually is faced with one question:
									Am I willing to work even harder to achieve something great?</p>
